github-binary-upload is a utility for publishing releases from tags with attached files on GitHub.

positional arguments:
  project               GitHub project in the format "<user>/<project name>"
  tag                   tag that will be published as a release, ignored if '
                        --latest' is given
  assets                files that will be attached to the release

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g GITHUB_SERVER, --github-server GITHUB_SERVER
                        GitHub server hostname (default: github.com)
  -c CREDENTIALS_FILE, --credentials-file CREDENTIALS_FILE
                        path to a file containing username and password/access
                        token (on two separate lines, default: ~/.github-
                        binary-uploadrc)
  -l, --latest          get the latest tag from the GitHub API
  -n, --dry-run         only print which releases would be published
  -u USERNAME, --user USERNAME
                        user account for querying the GitHub API; the password
                        is read from stdin
  -V, --version         print the version number and exit
```

### Example

Run

```bash
github-binary-upload -u ExampleUser -l ExampleUser/ExampleProject MyFirstAsset.zip MySecondAsset.whl
```

to create a release from the latest tag in the GitHub project `ExampleUser/ExampleProject`. The files `MyFirstAsset.zip`
and `MySecondAsset.whl` will be attached as downloadable files.

`github-binary-upload` can be called multiple times on the same tag. The release will be recreated each time. This is
especially useful to CI pipelines which can run more than once.

### Python API

`github-binary-upload` defines a function `publish_release_from_tag` which can be called from Python code:

```python
from github_binary_upload import publish_release_from_tag


publish_release_from_tag(
    project, tag, assets, github_server, username, password, dry_run
)
```

If `tag` is `None`, the latest tag will be converted to a GitHub release. `dry_run` is an optional parameter which
defaults to `False`.
